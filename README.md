# Taft Avenue Flood Twin Simulation and Generative Environment Modeling

This study addresses the critical challenge of urban flood monitoring in the Philippines, where traditional methodologies relying on point-source and manual assessments prove inadequate for capturing the requisite spatial and temporal complexity of flood events. A new method using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and World Foundational Models (WFM) was created for the synthesis of hyper-realistic flood imagery to address the widespread problem of data scarcity and improve model resilience. Initially, a high-fidelity 3D static twin of Taft Avenue was constructed using RealityCapture and NVIDIA Omniverse, establishing a highly accurate dimensional baseline. Images from this 3D model were then utilized to condition a multimodal GenAI model, driven by specific textual prompts, to produce a robust set of synthetic data. The utility of this synthetic data was rigorously validated against real-world footage (September 2023–August 2025) using established computer vision models, specifically YOLOv8 and ResNet. The results show that the computer vision models' capacity to correctly identify and categorize flood levels in accordance with predetermined standards was greatly enhanced by the addition of the GenAI-synthesized imagery, outperforming the performance attained with actual recorded footage alone.  Additionally, the monitoring system's overall generalization and predictive capability were greatly improved by the GenAI model's ability to generate uncommon or yet unrecorded extreme flood scenarios (such as waist-level to head-level).  This approach provides an effective, scalable way to enhance flood classification and detection in intricate urban settings.
